![Akasha page 7](akasha.png)

Akasha (आकाश) is a music of invisibility, electricity and the open expanse of
the sky. The title is the Sanskrit word for the æther, a concept once
understood as an unseen force present in all things in motion in the world. 

World premiere given by the [JACK Quartet](http:/jackquartet.com) on 6 February
2016 in Paine Hall on the campus of Harvard University. [Complete
recording](https://soundcloud.com/trevorbaca/akasha) available on Soundcloud.
