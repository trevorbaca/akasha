    6. breath

    7(1). microtonal polyphony in multiple instruments with moments of harmony
    mixed with extremely thin get. pianiss.
    8. breath

    9(3). microtonal polyphony in multiple instruments with moments of harmony;
    isolated three-note tasto loops fully contained by longer duration notes
    in microtonal polyphony
    10. breath

    11(1). microtonal polyphony in multiple instruments with moments of 
    harmony; isolated three-note tasto loops fully contained by longer duration

    12. halt

    16. breath

[B] (30")
    1(3). two-voice microtonal harmonies animated according to one rhythm; 
    mixed with two-note written-out alternation as implication of trill; with
    extremely thin get. pianiss. carried over from previous stage
    2-7. get. pianiss. fills in somewhat and continues longer than expected;
    descends register a little bit but not too much; halts inserted into
    descent but different type of halts than exposition halts heard so far
    8. two-note written-out prefiguration of trill resumes; now timed together
    with first appearance of detuned va, vc octave, possibly played only once

[C] (45")
    1-3(1+halt+2). sputtering exposition of detuned va, vc octave: time is 
    frozen during octave but very small glissandi lentissimi attempt to

    stops; then attempts to get underway; then stops; and so on. introduces 
    surprisingly short duration in middle of chain of attempts
    4(2). detuned octave field grows quiet under diminiuendo that leads to va, 
    vc OB; recapitulation of get. pianiss. descent

    scratch detache; scratch begins to align rhythmically with OB underneath;

    stage of segment; [two-voice microtonal harmonies recall previous segment]
