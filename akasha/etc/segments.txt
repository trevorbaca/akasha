intro (15")

[A] (30")
    1(2). microtonal cello line
    2. halt
    3(1). extremely thin get. pianiss.
    4. halt
    5(2). microtonal polyphony in multiple instruments with moments of harmony
    6. breath
    7(1). microtonal polyphony in multiple instruments with moments of harmony
    mixed with extremely thin get. pianiss.
    8. breath
    9(3). microtonal polyphony in multiple instruments with moments of harmony;
    isolated three-note tasto loops fully contained by longer duration notes
    in microtonal polyphony
    10. breath
    11(1). microtonal polyphony in multiple instruments with moments of 
    harmony; isolated three-note tasto loops fully contained by longer duration notes
    in microtonal polyphony
    12. halt
    13(1). three-note tasto loops; first hint of repetition
    14. halt
    15(1). tasto loops broken apart; dialogue with ext. thin get. pianiss.
    16. breath

[B] (30")
    1(3). two-voice microtonal harmonies animated according to one rhythm; 
    mixed with two-note written-out alternation as implication of trill; with
    extremely thin get. pianiss. carried over from previous stage
    2-7. get. pianiss. fills in somewhat and continues longer than expected;
    descends register a little bit but not too much; halts inserted into
    descent but different type of halts than exposition halts heard so far
    8. two-note written-out prefiguration of trill resumes; now timed together
    with first appearance of detuned va, vc octave, possibly played only once

[C] (45")
    1. sputtering exposition of detuned va, vc octave: time is frozen during
    octave but very small glissandi lentissimi attempt to activate the field of
    the detuned octave; attempt gets underway; then stops; then attempts to get
    underway; then stops; and so on. introduces surprisingly short duration in
    middle of chain of attempts
    2. detuned octave field grows quiet under diminiuendo that leads to va, vc
    OB; recapitulation of get. pianiss. descent
    3. get. pianiss. descent stalls and is interrupted by single scratch
    detache; scratch begins to align rhythmically with OB underneath;
    4. OB continues with rhythm of sputtering exposition introduced in first
    stage of segment; [two-voice microtonal harmonies recall previous segment]
    5. short end-cap of first appearance of trill combined with detuned octave
    combined with OB; segment ends with question mark

[D] (45")
    1. two-note spectral chord in vn1, vn2, va; time is frozen
    2. two-note spectral chord continues; ppp XSP glissandi animated underneath
    3. animation of ppp XSP glissandi spreads to all four players; rhythmic
    activation increases considerably; but ppp holds constant; players moving
    very very quickly with full bows in alternation; ends in short breath in
    all players to highlight reintroduction of trill in next stage
    4. [memory of previous segment: detuned octave field grows quiet under 
    diminiuendo; inserted as type of intercalation-as-memory]
    5. tutti ppp XSP glissandi resumes now capped with a single trill; happens
    once then another breath in all players
    6. tutti ppp XSP glissandi resumes again, capped again with a single trill
    now with the accompaniment of a slow low-register vc down-glissando; vc
    down-glissando outlasts rest of materials and closes segment unaccompanied
    7. grand pause

[E] (2')
    1. segment begins with mod. rhythmicized OB in viola; no OB in other
    players; large process of revealing getati begins; process begins with
    isolated scratch tenuti in v2; plenty of halting between scratches though
    now time behaves differently because of va OB accompaniment
    2. scratch become denser; va OB continues
    3. v1 joins v2; v1, v2 both play scratch detache; va OB continues
    4. v1, v2 scratch become get. ord. mf asc begins; va OB continues; accel.
    5. v1, v2 dense get. pian. asc.; va OB; accel.
    6. v1, v2 very dense get. pianiss. asc. molto; va OB; accel.
    7. short grand pause
    [8. v1, v2 max. dense get. pianiss. *withheld and does not appear yet*]

[F] (3')
    1. tempo resets back to mod.; microtonal vc melody returns from beginning
    of piece; get. represented by a single scratch tenuto that recalls
    beginning of previous segment; single tasto tenuto represents trills;
    2. [intercalated memory of v1, v2 very dense get. pianiss. from previous
    segment]
    3. tasto progresses from tenuti back to loops with characteristic local
    accel and rit. and so is effectively becoming faster; microtonal polyphony
    is going through process of getting slower and slower;
    4. tasto loops disappear; get. process begins again (with scratches, get.
    ord., etc etc) and begins accel.; micro polyphony reaches point of maximum
    slowness
    5. microtonal field arrives; tasto loops disappear; get. process still
    accel.
    6. get. process reachieves previous point of next-to-maximum density;
    microtonal field persists
    7. microtonal field disppears; get. reaches max. density (finally) and
    plays a stage; breath
    8. get. repeats previous stage but with single OB pedal underneath; breath
    9. all four players play get. field and get. field repeats eight times;
    eighth time is made 24ET; breath

[G] (1')
    1. microtonal field resumes 12ET in v2, va, vc SB; get. field handled
    exclusively as vn1 solo maximally fast and maximally dense; solo continues
    for a while
    2. vn1 solo stops; microtonal field sub. 24ET; SB > ord
    3. microtonal field sub. 12ET; ord > FB
    4. microtonal field sub. 24ET; FB > XFB; breath
    5. microtonal field (24ET) XFB with OB pedal underneath
    6. microtonal field sub. stop revealing OB pedal which continues through
    end of segment; section ends attaca next segment

[H] (30")
    1. tutti looping of 3-note tasto and trills (c5) with mixed mecc. fluido;
    2. [intercalated memory of XFB microtonal field (24ET)]; breath
    3. isolated va, vc detuned octave; breath
    repeat:
    1. tutti looping of 3-note tasto and trills (c5) with mixed mecc. fluido;
    2. [intercalated memory of XFB microtonal field (24ET)]; breath
    3. isolated va, vc detuned octave; breath

[I] (1'30")
    1. tutti detuned octave Bb with tutti swell; breath
    2. tutti pure octave Bb with tutti swell; attaca
    3. tutti detuned octave Bb with tutti swell; breath; quarter note OB + 3/4
    OB ppp revealed underneath (Bb)
    4. tutti ppp OB + 3/4 OB > 1/2 OB + 1/4 OB (Bb)
    5. tutti ppp 1/2 OB + 1/4 OB > 1/4 OB + XSP (Bb)
    6. [intercalated memory: tutti looping of 3-note tasto and trills (c5)
    with mixed mecc. fluido]
    7. transformation of tutti ppp XSP (Bb) to three-player ppp XSP with moving
    microtonal polyphony that recalls micropolyphony earlier in the piece; on
    top of this occurs a recapitulation of vn1 maximally dense get. solo from
    beginning of [G]; vn1 get. solo begins to rit.
    8. vn1 get. solo continues to rit and is now perforated; ppp XSP 
    microtonal polyphony sustains ppp but transitions gradually from XSP to 
    tasto
    9. vn1 get. solo continues to rit and is now very perforated;
    ppp tasto microtonal polyphony transitions from ord to SB
    10. vn1 get. solo continues to rit and is now silence with occ. get.
    strand; ppp SB microtonal polyphony transitions from SB to XSB; breath

[J] (3' maybe 4')
    1. vn1 silence with occ. get. strand; other three players tacet; halting
    2. vn1 silence with occ. get. strand; other three players resume finger
    chord of trill field and then begin upbows so incredibly slow as to produce
    only very very sparsely individuated clicks (all tasto)
    3. vn1 silence with occ. get. strand even thinner; other three players
    increase bow speed to slightly faster clicks (all tasto)
    4. vn1 silence almost complete; other three players transition slowly
    from individuated clicks to XSB (all tasto)
    5. tutti XSB > SB (all tasto)
    6. tutti SB > ord (all tasto)
    7. tutti tasto (trill root chord)
    8. tutti tasto trills begin
    9. tutti trills repeat six times with tutti swells and tasto > XSP > tasto
    enveloping; attaca
    10. tutti detuned octaves (A); repeats multiple times; tutti swells 
    persist; attaca
    11. sub. slower tempo; tutti trilled spectral chord (A); repeats multiple
    times; tutti swells persist; gigantic tutti crescendo to fff
    12. grand pause 

[K] (15")
    1. vc Bb1 + microtonal field in other three players played once in
    isolation; large pause
    2. vc Bb1 + microtonal field again then attaca tutti trilled chord one last
    time; vc Bb1 sustained as pedal over large pause

[L] (1'30")
    1. vc Bb1 sustained for a very long time with very very long crescendo;
    other three places tacet
    2. at peak of vc Bb1 crescendo other three players enter ppp in Bb octaves,
    all tasto
    3. pause
    4. tutti resume Bb octaves tasto, all ppp
    5. staggered tasto > ord
    6. staggered ord > SP; freeze
    7. staggered SP > MSP
    8. staggered MSP > XSP
    9. staggered XSP > 1/4 OB; freeze
    10. staggered 1/4 OB > 3/4 OB
    11. staggered 3/4 OB > OB
    12. tutti OB; freeze

[M] (30")
    1. sub. tempo slightly faster; tutti OB homorhythm with tutti rests between
    each stroke; microtonal polyphony hidden in glissandi in vn2, va, vc but do
    not sound because OB is completely without pitch; vn1 plays incredibly
    pianiss. get. strands with incredible perforation
    2. vn1 incredibly perforated get. pianiss.; vn2, va, vc bows freeze and 
    vn2, va, vc lh glissandi continue silently
    3. vn1 incredibly perforated get. pianiss.; vn2, va, vc freeze
    4. grand pause
